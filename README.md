The purpose of this application is to provide calculations on how much "Boom" can be made with whichever resource (Sulfur, Gun Powder, Explosives).
This is a calculator app created for the game Rust. The user will select the resource, then enter the amount of that resource they have, and last will select the type of "Boom" they want (Rockets, C4).
